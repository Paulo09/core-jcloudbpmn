2. GETTING STARTED
=============================================================================


To get started follow these steps:

- create a JCLOUDBPMN_HOME environment variable that points to the path of the JCLOUDBPMN distribution (the folder contain this file).

- add the bin folder in the JCLOUDBPMN distribution to the PATH environment variable

On a Windows computer these step are done as follows:

> set JCLOUDBPMN_HOME=C:\download\jcloudbpmn
> echo %JCLOUDBPMN_HOME%
C:\download\jcloudbpmn
> set PATH=%JCLOUDBPMN_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

On a Unix-like computer these steps are done as follows:

> set JCLOUDBPMN_HOME=~/download/jcloudbpmn
> export JCLOUDBPMN_HOME
> echo ${JCLOUDBPMN_HOME}
~/download/jcloudbpmn
> cd ${JCLOUDBPMN_HOME}
> set PATH=${JCLOUDBPMN_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
> export PATH
